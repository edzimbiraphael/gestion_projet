# Project: Ordonnancement

This project focuses on the scheduling and traceability of tasks for a specific system. Below is an overview of the main components and functionalities.

## File Structure

- `.idea/`: Configuration and project settings for the development environment.
- `E5_tables/`: Contains tables related to the scheduling (ordonnancement) aspect of the project.
- `E5_trace/`: Stores trace logs or execution traces related to the system's performance or actions.
- `lib/`: A directory for any external libraries or helper functions used in the project.
- `E5_graph.html`: An HTML file that generates or visualizes graphs related to task scheduling or system performance.
- `E5_main.py`: The main Python script that likely executes or manages the task scheduling and trace functionality of the system.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```
2. Ensure you have the necessary Python environment set up.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if any) listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Project

Execute the main script:
```bash
python E5_main.py
```

This will initiate the task scheduling process and provide output based on the trace logs and graphs generated during execution.

## Visualization

To view the generated graph, open `E5_graph.html` in your web browser after execution. This graph visualizes key aspects of the scheduling system's performance.

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute by opening issues or submitting pull requests. Make sure to follow the project's coding guidelines.
